## **Summary**

<pre>
What better way to learn how APIs work then through a free open source API such as the Star Wars API?

That is the purpose for me writing the Star Wars API app.  I continued my education with React and
Javascript along with Bootstrap 5.  This time however, I didn't use much CSS.  I just used strictly
Bootstrap to get a feel for Bootstrap and it's capabilities.  I learned from my last project that the
CSS has a hiarchy as to what commands are executed which is why I had so much trouble getting
things styled. In this app, I used this knowledge to make my life easier and turn the app into what it is.

The big thing I learned in this project was learning promises.  Promises are a complicated concept best
learned by using it.  And this is what I have accomplished in project.  I used Axios library to access the
Star Wars data.

The next big thing was manipulating the data to display on the screen.  For example, each human in the
database is listed as blank in the "species" column.  I had to add the "Human" word to replace the blank
field.

I learned how to make a button appear or disappear when it's needed, which is what I did for the previous
and next buttons.  I manged to figure out how to get the page navigation bar at the bottom to only show
the buttons that actually contain data in it to show.

All in all, this project was an amazing learning experience, and I enjoyed every minute of it.
